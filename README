cssh v0.1
 http://github.com/c3w/cssh

Purpose: Changes OSX Terminal Profile to n per machine.  Also supports tunneling #currently commented out
Create your Terminal profiles, under Terminal Preferences
alias ssh="~/bin/cssh"
make sure ~/bin is in your PATH, see ~/.profile

You're a sysadmin, or a developer.  You have tons of windows open but they all look the same!

No Longer!  Utilize your right-brain and colorize your terminal windows by function -
dev server, webserver, database, etc!  

Need to tunnel? no problem!  Need to have custom users, domain suffixes?  Go for it!

Hint: I use blue for dev, green for web, and red for databases -

:)
Chas.
